## Copy PUPPack data

Use the tool of your choice to copy the PUPPack video files to the Raspberry Pi (e.g. scp)

## Prepare videos

PiPUP requires the videos to be formated as plain H264 data streams without any container around it.
Therefore, you can't use the MP4 files from a PUPPack directly.
There's a simple script that converts all MP4 files to H264 data streams. Other formats are not 
supported today.
